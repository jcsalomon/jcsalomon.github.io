summary: "The “Favorite Quotations” list on my Facebook profile has gotten hard to find."
---

<p>
  I created <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joel.c.salomon">my Facebook profile</a>
  a while ago,
  and I haven’t been curating it much.
  And with all the changes Facebook makes
  to the way they display profiles,
  my “Favorite Quotations” list has gotten hard to find.
  So I’m moving it here,
  and getting <em>some</em> use out of this blog of mine.
</p>

<p id="massacre">
  &emsp;“In the same way, whenever a massacre of Armenians is reported from Asia Minor,
  every one assumes that it has been carried out ‘under orders’ from somewhere or another;
  no one seems to think that there are people who might like to kill their neighbours now and then.”<br />
  —Saki, in “Filboid Studge”
</p>

<p id="militia">
  &emsp;“The Second Amendment’s language,
  while speaking of a ‘Militia,’
  says nothing of ‘self-defense.’”<br />

<p id="understanding">
  &emsp;“The three-legged stool of understanding
  is held up by history, languages, and mathematics.
  Equipped with these three
  you can learn anything you want to learn.

  you are just another ignorant peasant
  with dung on your boots.”<br />

<p id="despecialization">
  &emsp;“A human being should be able to
  change a diaper,
  plan an invasion,
  butcher a hog,
  conn a ship,
  design a building,
  write a sonnet,
  balance accounts,
  build a wall,
  set a bone,
  comfort the dying,
  take orders,
  give orders,
  cooperate,
  act alone,
  solve equations,
  analyze a new problem,
  pitch manure,
  program a computer,
  cook a tasty meal,
  fight efficiently,
  die gallantly.
  Specialization is for insects.”<br />

<p id="pollyanna">
  &emsp;“I think this is some new, powerful, programming model,
  where you call things with structures that could be the same but really aren’t.
  I guess the idea is that
  the common elements of the structure are all the same, and declared first,
  so really, everything should just work out fine,
  even though the structures are all different.
  Everything’s fine, don’t worry, lie back and think of England.<br />
  &emsp;“I think we can call it Pollyanna-morphism.”<br />
