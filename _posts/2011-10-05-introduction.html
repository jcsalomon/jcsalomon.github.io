<p>
  I’d developed a blog theme for my
  <a href="/thesis">Optimal Control blog</a>,
  and it occurred to me that this might be a more generally useful thing.
  So I tweaked it some more, and now I have a general-purpose blog.

  What I’ll do with it, I do not yet know.
  Should be fun to find out, though.
